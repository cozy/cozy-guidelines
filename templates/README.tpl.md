[Cozy] <APP_NAME>
=======================


What's Cozy?
------------

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.

------------------

<APP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION>


Hack
----

### Install and run in dev mode

Hacking the <APP_NAME> app requires you to [setup a dev environment][setup].

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/<SLUG_GH>.git
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm install
```

:pushpin: If you use a node environment wrapper like [nvm] or [ndenv], don't forget to set your local node version before doing a `npm install`.

Cozy's apps use a standard set of _npm scripts_ to run common tasks. You can so start you development workflow with:

```sh
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm run watch
```

and point your browser to http://localhost:<APP_PORT>.


### Run it inside the VM

You can easily view your current running app in your VM, use [cozy-dev]:

```sh
# in a terminal, run your app in watch mode
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm run watch
```

```sh
# in another terminal, install cozy-dev (first time) and run the deploy
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm install -g cozy-dev
$ cozy-dev deploy <APP_PORT>
```

your app is available in your vm dashboard at http://localhost:9104.


### Tests

Tests are run by [mocha] under the hood, and written using [chai] and [sinon]. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm run test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.


## Models

The Cozy datastore stores documents, which can be seen as JSON objects. A `doctype` is simply a declaration of the fields in a given JSON object, to store similar objects in an homogeneous fashion.

Cozy ships a [built-in list of `doctypes`][doctypes] for representation of most of the common documents (Bills, Contacts, Events, ...).

Whenever your app needs to use a given `doctype`, you should:

- Check if this is a standard `doctype` defined in Cozy itself. If this is the case, you should add a model declaration in your app containing at least the fields listed in the [main fields list for this `doctype`][doctypes]. Note that you can extend the Cozy-provided `doctype` with your own customs fields. This is typically what is done in [Konnectors] for the [Bill `doctype`][bill-doctype].
- If no standards `doctypes` fit your needs, you should define your own `doctype` in your app. In this case, you do not have to put any field you want in your model, but you should crosscheck other cozy apps to try to homogeneize the names of your fields, so that your `doctype` data could be reused by other apps. This is typically the case for the [Konnector `doctype`][konnector-doctype] in [Konnectors].


### Resources

All documentation is located in the `/docs` app directory. It provides an exhaustive documentation about workflows (installation, development, pull-requestsâ€¦), architecture, code consistency, data structures, dependencies, and more.

Feel free to read it and fix / update it if needed, all comments and feedback to improve it are welcome!


### Open a Pull-Request

If you want to work on <APP_NAME> and submit code modifications, feel free to open pull-requests! See the [contributing guide][contribute] for more information about how to properly open pull-requests.


Community

### Localization

Localization and translations are handled by [Transifex][tx], which is used by all Cozy's apps.

As a _translator_, you can login to [Transifex][tx-signin] (using your Github account) and claim an access to the [app repository][tx-app]. Locales are pulled when app is build before publishing.

As a _developer_, you must [configure the transifex client][tx-client], and claim an access as _maintainer_ is the [app repository][tx-app]. Then please **only update** the source locale file (usually `en.json` in client and/or server parts), and push it to Transifex repository using the `tx push -s` command.


### Maintainer

The lead maintainer for Cozy <APP_NAME> is <APP_MAINTAINER>, send him/her a :beers: to say hello!


### Get in touch

You can reach the Cozy Community by:

- Chatting with us on IRC [#cozycloud on Freenode][freenode]
- Posting on our [Forum][forum]
- Posting issues on the [Github repos][github]
