What's <APP_NAME>?
------------------

<APP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION>


Hack
----

### Install and run in dev mode

Hacking the <APP_NAME> app requires you [setup a dev environment][setup].

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/<SLUG_GH>.git
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm install
```

:pushpin: If you use a node environment wrapper like [nvm] or [ndenv], don't forget to set your local node version before doing a `npm install`.

Cozy's apps use a standard set of _npm scripts_ to run common tasks. You can so start you development workflow with:

```sh
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm run watch
```

and point your browser to http://localhost:<APP_PORT>.


### Run it inside the VM

You can easily view your current running app in your VM, use [cozy-dev]:

```sh
# in a terminal, run your app in watch mode
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm run watch
```

```sh
# in another terminal, install cozy-dev (first time) and run the deploy
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm install -g cozy-dev
$ cozy-dev deploy <APP_PORT>
```

and point your browser to your dev VM at http://localhost:9104, your app is now available in your dashboard.


### Tests

Tests are run by [mocha] under the hood, and written using [chai] and [sinon]. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ cd <SLUG_GH>
$ npm run test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.


### Resources

All documentation is located in the `/docs` app directory. It provides an exhaustive documentation about worflows (installation, development, pull-requestsâ€¦), architecture, code consistency, data structures, dependencies, and more.

Feel free to read it and fix / update it if needed, all comments and feedback to improve it are welcome!


### Open a Pull-Request

If you want to work on <APP_NAME> and submit code modifications, feel free to open pull-requests! Our basic worflow is:

- PR point to the `development` branch
- You need to cover your code and feature by tests
- You may add documentation in the `/docs` directory to explain your choices if needed
- you do _not_ need to build app to submit a PR
- you should update the Transifex source locale file if you modify it for your feature needs (see Localization section below)


Community
---------

### Localization

Localization and translations are handled by [Transifex][tx], which is used by all Cozy's apps.

As a _translator_, you can login to [Transifex][tx-signin] (using your Github account) and claim an access to the [app repository][tx-app]. Locales are pulled when app is build before publishing.

As a _developer_, you must [configure the transifex client][tx-client], and claim an access as _maintainer_ is the [app repository][tx-app]. Then please **only update** the source locale file (usually `en.json` in client and/or server parts), and push it to Transifex repository using the `tx push` command.


### Maintainer

The lead maintainer for Cozy <APP_NAME> is <APP_MAINTAINER>, send him/her a :beers: to say hello!


### Get in touch

You can reach the Cozy Community by:

- Chatting with us on IRC [#cozycloud on Freenode][freenode]
- Posting on our [Forum][forum]
- Posting issues on the [Github repos][github]
- Say Hi! on [Twitter][twitter]
